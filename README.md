# Learning smart contract development

## Powered by the Zilliqa project

This repository serves the purpose of collecting notes and source code written when learning how to develop with the Zilliqa blockchain.

To program smart contracts with zilliqa you need to use a language called Scilla.

Scilla is a functional programming language, noy as low level as C, not as high level as Python but at an intermediate level of abstraction.

Scilla also enforces variable type checking and overall is engineered to be a safe language to use. The Zilliqa team created this language after learning about all the various security issues ethereum had recently and in the past.

## Smart Contract Examples

You can find smart contract examples in the `./contracts` directory.
